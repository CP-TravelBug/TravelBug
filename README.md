# Group Project -- TravelBug

**TravelBug** is an android app that allows a user to record their experience while taking a trip in
a way that can be shared with friends and family after/or during the trip. The app records the
user's itinerary through a trip, including pictures, videos and text snippets and creates a timeline
of trip events that can be shared with friends and family. The sharing can happen during the trip,
in which case the recipients get an constantly updated version of the events, or after the trip.
